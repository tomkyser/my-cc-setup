# Dynamo

## What This Is

A Claude Code power-user platform, Dynamo, comprising two systems: **Ledger** (memory — knowledge storage, retrieval, inference via Graphiti) and **Switchboard** (management — hooks, diagnostics, sync, stack, CLI). Built on a Node/CJS shared substrate at `~/.claude/dynamo/` with 272 passing tests. v1.0 researched and ranked tools. v1.1 diagnosed and fixed the memory system. v1.2 rewrote the entire foundation from Python/Bash to CJS with full feature parity.

## Core Value

Every capability must be self-manageable by Claude Code (install, configure, update, troubleshoot) without requiring manual user intervention in config files.

## Current Milestone: v1.2.1 Stabilization and Polish

**Goal:** Close the gaps between v1.2's CJS rewrite and v1.3's intelligence work — branding, documentation, legacy cleanup, directory restructure, dev toggles, and architecture capture.

**Target features:**
- Complete Dynamo rebranding (README, repo, docs, directory structure)
- Archive and remove legacy Python/Bash system
- Exhaustive documentation and CLAUDE.md integration
- Update/upgrade system for self-management
- Global on/off and dev mode toggles
- Neo4j admin browser fix
- Architecture and design decision capture for development continuity

## Requirements

### Validated

- ✓ Graphiti MCP for memory/knowledge graph — existing, fully operational
- ✓ DDEV + Docker local dev environment — existing
- ✓ GSD framework for project planning/execution — existing
- ✓ Vetting protocol with 4 binary hard gates — v1.0
- ✓ Anti-features list with named exclusions — v1.0
- ✓ Ranked report with 5 primary + 2 conditional tool recommendations — v1.0
- ✓ Root cause diagnosis of silent hook failures (GRAPHITI_GROUP_ID override) — v1.1
- ✓ Root cause diagnosis of missing project-scoped memories — v1.1
- ✓ Hook reliability: all hooks persist or visibly fail, with error logging — v1.1
- ✓ Session management: list, view, label, auto-name via CLI — v1.1
- ✓ Memory system verified end-to-end with verify-memory command — v1.1
- ✓ Bidirectional sync between live ~/.claude and this repo — v1.1
- ✓ CJS architectural foundation (shared substrate for Ledger + Switchboard) — v1.2
- ✓ Dynamo/Ledger/Switchboard branding and project restructure — v1.2
- ✓ Modular injection pattern established — v1.2
- ✓ Feature parity: existing hooks, session mgmt, health checks, sync on CJS — v1.2
- ✓ Master Roadmap: prioritize and assign backlog to v1.3-v2.0 — v1.2
- ✓ STAB-08: Directory structure refactor — v1.2.1 Phase 12
- ✓ STAB-09: Component scope refactor — v1.2.1 Phase 12
- ✓ STAB-10: Global on/off and dev mode toggles — v1.2.1 Phase 12

### Active (v1.2.1)

- STAB-01: README and rebranding pass
- STAB-02: Archive legacy Python/Bash system
- STAB-03: Exhaustive documentation
- STAB-04: Dynamo CLI integration in CLAUDE.md
- STAB-05: Update/upgrade system
- STAB-06: Architecture and design decision capture

### Out of Scope

- Database/SQL access MCPs — not requested
- Real-time chat/notification for errors — visible error output is sufficient
- ESM modules — CJS is the standard in this ecosystem

## Context

Shipped v1.0 (research), v1.1 (memory fixes), and v1.2 (CJS rewrite) across 11 phases and 24 plans.
Phase 12 complete — repo restructured into 3 root directories (`dynamo/`, `ledger/`, `switchboard/`), boundary enforcement added, global toggle with blackout capability, all MCP tools wrapped as CLI commands.
Tech stack: Node/CJS (dynamo/), Docker (Graphiti stack), Claude Haiku (session naming via OpenRouter).
Total project: ~7,000 LOC CJS (3,585 production + 3,382 test) plus prompts.
Python/Bash legacy retired to `~/.claude/graphiti-legacy/`.
v1.2.1 has 10 stabilization requirements (STAB-01 through STAB-10). Future backlog beyond v1.2.1: 26 items across memory enhancement, management, UI documented in MASTER-ROADMAP.md.

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Research only, no install | User wants vetted list first, will install later | ✓ Good — clean separation |
| Global scope only | Tools should be universally available, not per-project | ✓ Good |
| Full lifecycle self-management | User never wants to manually edit config files | ✓ Good |
| Lean final list (5-8) | Quality over quantity | ✓ Good — 5+2 recommendations |
| Diagnostic-first milestone (v1.1) | Fix memory before adding features | ✓ Good — root causes found and fixed |
| Global scope + [project] content prefix | Graphiti v1.21.0 rejects colon in group_id | ✓ Good — workaround documented |
| Two-phase auto-naming via Haiku | Cost-efficient (~$0.001/call) with graceful degradation | ✓ Good |
| Foreground hook execution with 5s timeout | Error capture requires foreground; fast timeout prevents blocking | ✓ Good |
| Rebrand to Dynamo/Ledger/Switchboard | Separate memory from management for independent evolution | ✓ Good — clean architecture |
| CJS rewrite over Python/Bash | GSD-pattern CJS is proven, modular, testable; unifies tech stack | ✓ Good — 272 tests, feature parity |
| Feature parity before new features | Stable foundation first, new capabilities in v1.3+ | ✓ Good — foundation solid |
| Content-based sync (Buffer.compare) | More accurate than mtime-only conflict detection | ✓ Good |
| Options-based test isolation | Stage/module functions accept overrides for test isolation | ✓ Good — all tests use tmpdir |
| Settings.json backup before modification | Atomic write (tmp+rename) with .bak for rollback | ✓ Good — safe cutover |
| Graphiti MCP deregistered; CLI commands replace MCP tools | Toggle blackout requires all memory access through Dynamo CLI | ✓ Good — complete blackout when disabled |
| Repo renamed to "dynamo" on GitHub | Reflect Dynamo identity in repo name, not just internal naming | Pending |
| Branch renamed from main to master | Team convention preference; aligns with project terminology | Done |
| Insert v1.2.1 before v1.3 | Close stabilization gaps (docs, branding, legacy cleanup, toggles) before building intelligence layer | Done -- 10 STAB requirements scoped |

## Constraints

- **Self-management**: Claude Code must be able to fully manage the tool lifecycle
- **Scope**: Global only — lives in ~/.claude or global config
- **Platform**: macOS (Darwin), zsh, Homebrew available
- **Architecture**: Node/CJS, zero npm dependencies beyond js-yaml
- **Testing**: node:test built-in, 100% test isolation via tmpdir
- **Component scope**: Dynamo (orchestration/CLI), Ledger (memory/knowledge), Switchboard (management/ops) — boundaries must be honored in design, code, and naming
- **Branch workflow**: Development on `dev` branch. Push to origin after commits. Merge dev → master and push on milestone completion only.
- **Disruption awareness**: Notify the user when testing or development will interrupt current usage of any part of Dynamo in the active thread or any other active Claude threads.

## Per-Phase Checklist

These items must be assessed during every phase's planning and execution. Not all will apply every phase — but each must be explicitly evaluated and addressed if affected.

- [ ] **User-facing docs and README**: Deep pass to assess what needs to be modified or added. Update as changes are made within the phase, not deferred.
- [ ] **Sync, install, and update scripts**: Deep pass to assess if affected by this phase's changes. Update if so.
- [ ] **Component scope adherence**: Verify that Dynamo/Ledger/Switchboard scope boundaries are honored in both design and naming. Flag violations and address in phase discussion.
- [ ] **CLAUDE.md and injectable templates**: Update to reflect current usage and rules of Dynamo and its systems (both passive and active). Include self-management instructions to keep Dynamo up to date.
- [ ] **Dynamo toggle awareness**: If a global on/off or dev mode toggle exists, ensure phase work respects it and updates toggle behavior if scope changes.
