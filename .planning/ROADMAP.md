### v1.3-M2 Core Intelligence (Planned)

**Milestone Goal:** Make the memory system intelligent through the Inner Voice and dual-path architecture. Reverie replaces Haiku curation with context-aware, personality-driven injection. Hybrid architecture: CJS command hooks for hot path + custom subagents for deliberation.

**Phase Numbering:**
- Integer phases (23, 24, 25): Planned milestone work
- Decimal phases (e.g., 23.1): Urgent insertions (marked with INSERTED)

- [x] **Phase 23: Foundation and Routing** - Data structures, operational monitoring, feature flag, dispatcher dual-mode routing, and stub handlers (completed 2026-03-20)
- [x] **Phase 24: Cognitive Pipeline** - Core orchestration, dual-path routing, curation migration, all 7 handlers, subagent integration, and state bridge (completed 2026-03-20)
- [ ] **Phase 25: Cutover & Completion** - Classic mode removal, voice CLI commands, bare CLI shim, changelog integration, and install pipeline updates

## Phase Details

### Phase 23: Foundation and Routing
**Goal**: Reverie subsystem has its foundational data structures, operational monitoring, feature flag system, and a working dispatcher that routes events to stub handlers based on mode -- without changing any existing behavior
**Depends on**: Phase 22 (M1 complete)
**Requirements**: IV-01, IV-02, IV-03, IV-04, IV-10, IV-12, OPS-MON-01, OPS-MON-02, FLAG-01, FLAG-03, HOOK-01, HOOK-02, HOOK-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. `dynamo config set reverie.mode classic` and `dynamo config get reverie.mode` round-trip correctly; mode defaults to `classic` on fresh install
  2. With mode set to `classic`, all existing hook behavior is identical to v1.3-M1 -- no user-visible change from the feature flag or routing modification
  3. With mode set to `cortex`, dispatcher routes events to Reverie stub handlers that produce the same output as classic Ledger handlers (pass-through stubs)
  4. Inner Voice state file loads from disk, persists atomically, and recovers gracefully from corruption (truncated/invalid JSON resets to fresh defaults)
  5. `activation.cjs` computes entity extraction, activation decay, 1-hop spreading, domain frame classification, and sublimation scoring -- all validated by unit tests with sub-5ms entity extraction and sub-1ms classification benchmarks
**Plans:** 3/3 plans complete
Plans:
- [x] 23-01-PLAN.md -- Config module (lib/config.cjs), state module (subsystems/reverie/state.cjs), and CLI router integration
- [x] 23-02-PLAN.md -- Activation computation engine (entity extraction, spreading activation, decay, classification, sublimation scoring, spawn tracking)
- [x] 23-03-PLAN.md -- 7 Reverie handler stubs, dispatcher dual-mode routing, and SubagentStart/SubagentStop registration

### Phase 24: Cognitive Pipeline
**Goal**: The Inner Voice processes every hook event through a cognitive pipeline -- extracting entities, updating activation maps, selecting hot or deliberation path, formatting injections within token budgets, and communicating with the deliberation subagent via a crash-safe state bridge
**Depends on**: Phase 23
**Requirements**: IV-05, IV-06, IV-07, IV-08, IV-09, IV-11, PATH-01, PATH-02, PATH-03, PATH-04, PATH-05, PATH-06
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Hot path completes under 500ms end-to-end (state load through injection formatting through state persist) with per-step timing instrumentation visible in debug output; 400ms abort threshold prevents overruns
  2. Path selection (hot/deliberation/skip) is deterministic based on activation signals -- no LLM call required for the routing decision itself
  3. Deliberation subagent (`cc/agents/inner-voice.md`) spawns on semantic shift or low-confidence signals; rate limit detection degrades to hot-path-only when spawn fails
  4. State bridge writes deliberation results via SubagentStop with correlation ID and 60s TTL; next UserPromptSubmit atomically consumes the result via `fs.renameSync`; stale or crashed results are detected and discarded
  5. Injection formatting respects token limits (500 session start, 150 mid-session, 50 urgent) and uses adversarial counter-prompting templates
**Plans:** 4/4 plans complete
Plans:
- [x] 24-01-PLAN.md -- Dual-path routing module (path selection, semantic shift, recall detection, token management, injection formatting) and inner-voice subagent definition
- [x] 24-02-PLAN.md -- Reverie curation module (template-based formatting, token limits, adversarial framing) and 5 Inner Voice prompt templates
- [x] 24-03-PLAN.md -- Pipeline orchestrator (inner-voice.cjs) with per-hook cognitive pipelines, state bridge, and hot-path timing instrumentation
- [x] 24-04-PLAN.md -- All 7 handler rewrites replacing pass-through stubs with cognitive pipeline delegation

### Phase 25: Cutover & Completion
**Goal**: Classic mode removed entirely, Reverie is the only pipeline, voice CLI commands provide Inner Voice visibility, bare CLI access works without node prefix, update notes workflow integrated, and install pipeline deploys all new Reverie files
**Depends on**: Phase 24
**Requirements**: FLAG-02, FLAG-04, OPS-01, OPS-02, OPS-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Classic Ledger curation path removed: `reverie.mode` config key eliminated, dispatcher always routes to Reverie handlers, `ledger/curation.cjs` callHaiku removed, OpenRouter dependency removed, original 5 cc/prompts/ templates deleted
  2. `dynamo voice status` shows full Inner Voice state dump (all entities with scores, domain frame, predictions, self-model, injection history); `dynamo voice explain` shows rationale for the last injection decision; `dynamo voice reset` clears self-model, predictions, and injection history while preserving activation map
  3. Running `dynamo` from any terminal (without `node` prefix or full path) invokes the CLI via a symlink shim; `DYNAMO_DEV=1` overrides to the repo version
  4. CHANGELOG.md exists with well-written update notes generated from git; `dynamo check-update` and `dynamo update` display relevant changelog entries
  5. `dynamo install` and `dynamo sync` deploy all new Reverie files, `cc/agents/`, and `cc/prompts/iv-*` templates; install actively cleans up removed classic-mode files from existing deployments
**Plans:** 1/4 plans executed
Plans:
- [ ] 25-01-PLAN.md -- Classic mode removal (dispatcher, config, health checks, dead code deletion, test updates)
- [x] 25-02-PLAN.md -- Bare CLI shim and CHANGELOG.md integration
- [ ] 25-03-PLAN.md -- Voice CLI commands (status, explain, reset)
- [ ] 25-04-PLAN.md -- Install/sync pipeline updates with active cleanup
