# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-17)

**Core value:** Every capability must be self-manageable by Claude Code without manual user config file edits
**Current focus:** Phase 11 -- Master Roadmap (complete)

## Current Position

Phase: 11 of 11 (Master Roadmap)
Plan: 1 of 1 (all plans complete)
Status: v1.2 milestone complete
Last activity: 2026-03-18 -- Completed 11-01 Master Roadmap

Progress: [██████████] 100%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 21 (across v1.0 + v1.1 + v1.2)
- Average duration: --
- Total execution time: --

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| v1.0 Phases 1-3 | 8 | -- | -- |
| v1.1 Phases 4-7 | 8 | -- | -- |
| 08-01 Foundation | 3 tasks | 5min | ~2min |
| 08-02 MCP Client + Tests | 2 tasks | 4min | ~2min |
| 08-03 Regression Tests | 2 tasks | 3min | ~2min |
| 09-02 Sessions Module | 1 task (TDD) | 3min | 3min |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- Rebranded project: Dynamo (umbrella), Ledger (memory), Switchboard (management)
- CJS architectural rewrite following GSD patterns
- Feature parity first, new capabilities deferred to v1.3+
- SWB-03 (diagnostics), SWB-07 (sync), SWB-08 (stack) included in v1.2 -- no deferrals
- Coarse granularity: 4 phases for 29 requirements
- Branding merged with Foundation (both establish the new structure)
- Operations merged with Cutover (one delivery: system deployed and running)
- Dynamo files tracked in both repo dynamo/ and deployed to ~/.claude/dynamo/ (following graphiti sync model)
- core.cjs is single shared substrate with 11 exports (10 functions + DYNAMO_DIR)
- scope.cjs is standalone with zero internal dependencies
- MCPClient constructor reads config via loadConfig() for URL/timeout defaults
- parseSSE is a standalone exported function for direct unit testing
- URL resolution priority: env var > options > config > defaults
- Regression tests 10-12 define interface contracts for Phase 9 (stop hook, two-phase naming, user label preservation)
- Codebase-scanning regression approach catches anti-patterns structurally via regex
- sessions.cjs: options object pattern with filePath override for test isolation
- sessions.cjs: async functions for backfill and generateAndApplyName (supports HTTP-based name generators)
- sessions.cjs: dual guard on indexSession (user labels + non-empty existing labels)
- [Phase 09]: Prompt variable names match actual template placeholders ({context} for session-summary and session-name)
- [Phase 09]: callHaiku is the shared low-level function for all OpenRouter calls; extractContent lives in episodes.cjs and is imported by search.cjs
- [Phase 09]: Dispatcher builds enriched ctx object (project, scope) before routing to handlers
- [Phase 09]: Stop handler uses budget-based timeout (25s budget, 5s buffer) with priority ordering
- [Phase 09]: Stop handler has dual infinite loop guard (stop_hook_active + temp file flag via process.ppid)
- [Phase 10]: sync.cjs uses Buffer.compare for content-based conflict detection (more accurate than mtime-only)
- [Phase 10]: 11-entry SYNC_EXCLUDES includes config.json (per-deployment) and tests (repo-only)
- [Phase 10]: stack.cjs uses explicit -f flag on all docker compose calls (never relies on cwd)
- [Phase 10]: Options-based overrides (graphitiDir, settingsPath, dynamoDir, mcpUrl) for stage test isolation
- [Phase 10]: Stage status hierarchy: FAIL for critical vars, WARN for non-fatal
- [Phase 10]: ANSI color codes inline with TTY detection, pretty output to stderr
- [Phase 10]: Stage functions accessed via stages[def.fn] string key for test mockability
- [Phase 10]: _returnOnly parameter on run() functions bypasses process.exit for test capture
- [Phase 10]: diagnose.cjs tracks both failed and skipped stages for transitive dependency resolution
- [Phase 10]: verify-memory uses inline ANSI (not pretty.cjs) because check-based format differs from stage-based
- [Phase 11-master-roadmap]: v1.3 gets 10 requirements (intelligence + modularity as foundational layer)
- [Phase 11-master-roadmap]: MGMT-04 (TweakCC) assigned to v1.5 with dashboard for cohesive UX

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Stop hook timeout cap needs empirical measurement in Phase 9
- MCP notifications/initialized handshake needs verification in Phase 8
- Haiku model ID (anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5) stability should be confirmed in Phase 9
