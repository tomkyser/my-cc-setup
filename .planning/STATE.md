# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-16)

**Core value:** Every recommended tool must be self-manageable by Claude Code without manual user config file edits
**Current focus:** Milestone v1.1 — Phase 4: Diagnostics

## Current Position

Plan: 2 of 2 in current phase (Task 1 complete, awaiting checkpoint:human-verify)
Status: In progress — Plan 2 of 2 at checkpoint
Last activity: 2026-03-17 — Health check script built; 6-stage pipeline check with canary round-trip; awaiting user verification

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [v1.1-init]: Diagnostic-first milestone — make memory system work as designed before considering improvements
- [v1.1-init]: Root cause: hooks display status messages but MCP calls to Graphiti fail silently
- [v1.1-init]: Zero project-scoped memories stored despite hooks appearing to execute
- [v1.1-roadmap]: Phase 6 (Session Management) depends on Phase 5 (Hook Reliability) — session features require working hooks
- [04-01-diag]: DIAG-01 confirmed: NOT a silent write failure — writes succeed; 2>/dev/null is a future risk but not current root cause
- [04-01-diag]: DIAG-02 confirmed: GRAPHITI_GROUP_ID=global in docker-compose.yml overrides per-request group_id; API v1.21.0 echoes requested group_id in response but stores as global
- [04-01-diag]: Project detection is correct — detect-project returns 'my-cc-setup' from git remote, iCloud path is not the issue
- [04-01-diag]: Fix direction for DIAG-02: remove GRAPHITI_GROUP_ID from docker-compose.yml and test server respects per-request group_id
- [04-02-health]: Canary uses group_id='global' until Phase 5 fix — project scope writes land in global per DIAG-02; canary read-empty is WARN not FAIL
- [04-02-health]: health-check.py WARN status = write succeeded + read empty (DIAG-02 behavior); FAIL = connection refused / API down
- [Phase 04-02]: Canary uses group_id='global' until Phase 5 fix — project scope writes land in global per DIAG-02; canary read-empty is WARN not FAIL
- [Phase 04-02]: health-check.py WARN status = write succeeded + read empty (DIAG-02 behavior); FAIL = connection refused / API down
- [Phase 04-02]: 6-stage health check reuses probe patterns from diagnose.py but is a quick status tool, not a full diagnostic; diagnose.py remains for deep analysis

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- RESOLVED: Hooks fire and print status but actual mcp__graphiti__add_memory calls may not execute or may error silently — ACTUALLY: writes succeed, 2>/dev/null is a risk but not a current failure
- RESOLVED ROOT CAUSE: No project-scoped episodes exist — BECAUSE: server-level GRAPHITI_GROUP_ID=global overrides all group_id values to global
- Global scope has data (10+ episodes including session summaries) — scope isolation is the fix needed
