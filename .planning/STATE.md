# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-17)

**Core value:** Every capability must be self-manageable by Claude Code without manual user config file edits
**Current focus:** Phase 8 -- Foundation and Branding

## Current Position

Phase: 8 of 11 (Foundation and Branding) -- COMPLETE
Plan: 3 of 3 (all complete)
Status: Phase 8 Complete
Last activity: 2026-03-17 -- Completed 08-03 regression test suite, Phase 8 complete

Progress: [██████████] 100%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 16 (across v1.0 + v1.1)
- Average duration: --
- Total execution time: --

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| v1.0 Phases 1-3 | 8 | -- | -- |
| v1.1 Phases 4-7 | 8 | -- | -- |
| 08-01 Foundation | 3 tasks | 5min | ~2min |
| 08-02 MCP Client + Tests | 2 tasks | 4min | ~2min |
| 08-03 Regression Tests | 2 tasks | 3min | ~2min |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- Rebranded project: Dynamo (umbrella), Ledger (memory), Switchboard (management)
- CJS architectural rewrite following GSD patterns
- Feature parity first, new capabilities deferred to v1.3+
- SWB-03 (diagnostics), SWB-07 (sync), SWB-08 (stack) included in v1.2 -- no deferrals
- Coarse granularity: 4 phases for 29 requirements
- Branding merged with Foundation (both establish the new structure)
- Operations merged with Cutover (one delivery: system deployed and running)
- Dynamo files tracked in both repo dynamo/ and deployed to ~/.claude/dynamo/ (following graphiti sync model)
- core.cjs is single shared substrate with 11 exports (10 functions + DYNAMO_DIR)
- scope.cjs is standalone with zero internal dependencies
- MCPClient constructor reads config via loadConfig() for URL/timeout defaults
- parseSSE is a standalone exported function for direct unit testing
- URL resolution priority: env var > options > config > defaults
- Regression tests 10-12 define interface contracts for Phase 9 (stop hook, two-phase naming, user label preservation)
- Codebase-scanning regression approach catches anti-patterns structurally via regex

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Stop hook timeout cap needs empirical measurement in Phase 9
- MCP notifications/initialized handshake needs verification in Phase 8
- Haiku model ID (anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5) stability should be confirmed in Phase 9
