# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-19)

**Core value:** Every capability must be self-manageable by Claude Code without manual user config file edits
**Current focus:** v1.3 architecture specification in progress (260319-fzc plans 03-05 remaining)

## Current Position

Phase: 17 (deploy-pipeline-fixes) — COMPLETE
Plan: 3 of 3 (all complete)

### Prior Milestones

v1.0 (3 phases, 8 plans), v1.1 (4 phases, 8 plans), v1.2 (4 phases, 12 plans) -- all shipped.
Total prior: 11 phases, 28 plans completed.

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [v1.2.1 scoping]: Insert v1.2.1 before v1.3 to close stabilization gaps
- [Phase ordering]: Structural refactors (STAB-08, STAB-09) first since they affect file paths everywhere
- [Phase ordering]: Dev toggles (STAB-10) early to enable safe development of subsequent phases
- [Phase ordering]: Documentation (STAB-01, STAB-03, STAB-04, STAB-06) after structural changes so docs describe the final state
- [12-01 circular deps]: Used Object.assign(module.exports) pattern to break core.cjs <-> ledger circular dependency
- [12-01 resolveCore]: Dual-path resolution checks deployed layout first, falls back to repo layout
- [12-01 re-exports]: loadSessions/listSessions re-exported through core.cjs for boundary compliance
- [12-02 isEnabled]: configPath param for test isolation, reads deployed config by default
- [12-02 REPO_ROOT]: Renamed REPO_DIR to REPO_ROOT in switchboard modules for clarity
- [12-02 SYNC_PAIRS]: Sync uses per-pair excludes array for clean 3-dir iteration
- [12-03 requireEnabled]: Toggle gate respects DYNAMO_CONFIG_PATH env var for test isolation
- [12-03 lazy require]: Memory commands use lazy require() inside switch cases to avoid loading ledger at startup
- [12-03 formatOutput]: stderr for human text, stdout for json/raw -- matches existing output() pattern
- [Phase 12]: [12-04 deregistration]: Used claude mcp remove CLI for Graphiti deregistration (preferred over manual JSON editing)
- [Phase 12]: [12-04 CLAUDE.md]: Preserved all non-memory sections, replaced only the Graphiti MCP block with Dynamo CLI instructions
- [Phase 13]: [13-01 archival]: Tagged v1.2-legacy-archive on dev before deletions for permanent historical reference
- [Phase 14]: Full rewrite of all 7 codebase maps rather than incremental patches -- old Python/Bash content was entirely stale
- [Phase 14]: All 20+ CLI commands included in CLAUDE.md grouped by category (Memory, Session, System, Diagnostics)
- [Phase 14]: 19 structured decision blocks in PROJECT.md (3 more than 16 minimum) covering v1.0 through v1.2.1
- [Phase 15]: Hand-rolled semver comparison (3-component numeric) to maintain zero-dependency constraint
- [Phase 15]: Separate 404 handling from network errors for specific No releases published yet message
- [Phase 15]: [15-02 compareVersions]: Duplicated in migrate.cjs intentionally -- each switchboard module is self-contained per codebase convention
- [Phase 15]: [15-02 migration filter]: Uses >= for source version and <= for target version to include boundary migrations
- [Phase 15]: Snapshot backup uses existing copyTree from install.cjs -- no new directory copy logic
- [Phase 15]: install.cjs rollback() checks dynamo-backup/ first for full-snapshot restore, falls back to legacy settings-only
- [Phase 15]: [15-04 check-update]: Human-readable status to stderr, --format json to stdout -- no output() call in non-JSON mode
- [Phase 15]: [15-04 inline status]: check-update exits cleanly without calling output() since status was already written to stderr
- [Phase 16]: [16-01 resolveSibling]: Dual-layout path resolution in dynamo.cjs -- checks repo path first, falls back to deployed path
- [Phase 16]: [16-01 permissions cleanup]: Removed entire permissions block from settings-hooks.json -- Graphiti MCP is deregistered, no permissions needed
- [Phase 17]: [17-01 resolveHandlers]: Same dual-layout pattern as resolveSibling -- repo path first, deployed fallback
- [Phase 17]: [17-01 defensive deregistration]: MCP deregistration is defensive -- OK status whether graphiti was registered or not
- [Phase 17]: [17-02 collectAllCjsFiles]: Root-level non-recursive + explicit production subdir recursion to avoid scanning test files
- [Phase 17]: [17-02 shebang branding]: Branding test allows shebang on line 1 with identity block on line 2 for CLI entry points
- [260319-17p]: Concept 7 verdict corrected from NO-GO to CONDITIONAL GO -- hybrid architecture (CJS hooks for hot path + custom subagent for deliberation)
- [260319-17p]: Dual cost model: subscription users $0.37/day, API users $1.98/day for v1.3 Inner Voice
- [260319-17p]: State file bridge pattern for SubagentStop-to-parent context gap
- [260319-fzc-01]: Platform-agnostic Inner Voice concept separated from platform-specific spec (INNER-VOICE-ABSTRACT.md)
- [260319-fzc-01]: Six-subsystem architecture defined (Dynamo, Switchboard, Ledger, Assay, Terminus, Reverie)
- [260319-fzc-01]: cc/ adapter pattern for Claude Code platform isolation
- [260319-fzc-01]: v1.3 milestoned delivery (1.3-M1 through 1.3-M7), no planning beyond 1.3
- [260319-fzc-02]: Terminus is stateless transport -- provides the pipe, does not decide what flows through
- [260319-fzc-02]: Switchboard dispatches but does not handle -- handlers belong to owning subsystems
- [260319-fzc-02]: Static hook handler routing (hardcoded table, not dynamic registration)
- [260319-fzc-02]: graphiti/ stays top-level, referenced by Terminus through config
- [260319-fzc-02]: cc/ directory owned by Switchboard for deployment; content authored by Reverie
