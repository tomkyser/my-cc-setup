# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-16)

**Core value:** Every recommended tool must be self-manageable by Claude Code without manual user config file edits
**Current focus:** Milestone v1.1 — Phase 6: Session Management

## Current Position

Phase: 6 of 7 (Session Management) -- COMPLETE
Plan: 2 of 2 complete in current phase
Status: Phase 6 complete -- ready for Phase 7 (Verification and Sync)
Last activity: 2026-03-17 — Session auto-naming: two-phase Haiku naming in prompt-augment.sh and session-summary.sh, SESS-04 complete

Progress: [██████████] 100%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [v1.1-init]: Diagnostic-first milestone — make memory system work as designed before considering improvements
- [v1.1-init]: Root cause: hooks display status messages but MCP calls to Graphiti fail silently
- [v1.1-init]: Zero project-scoped memories stored despite hooks appearing to execute
- [v1.1-roadmap]: Phase 6 (Session Management) depends on Phase 5 (Hook Reliability) — session features require working hooks
- [04-01-diag]: DIAG-01 confirmed: NOT a silent write failure — writes succeed; 2>/dev/null is a future risk but not current root cause
- [04-01-diag]: DIAG-02 confirmed: GRAPHITI_GROUP_ID=global in docker-compose.yml overrides per-request group_id; API v1.21.0 echoes requested group_id in response but stores as global
- [04-01-diag]: Project detection is correct — detect-project returns 'my-cc-setup' from git remote, iCloud path is not the issue
- [04-01-diag]: Fix direction for DIAG-02: remove GRAPHITI_GROUP_ID from docker-compose.yml and test server respects per-request group_id
- [04-02-health]: Canary uses group_id='global' until Phase 5 fix — project scope writes land in global per DIAG-02; canary read-empty is WARN not FAIL
- [04-02-health]: health-check.py WARN status = write succeeded + read empty (DIAG-02 behavior); FAIL = connection refused / API down
- [Phase 04-02]: Canary uses group_id='global' until Phase 5 fix — project scope writes land in global per DIAG-02; canary read-empty is WARN not FAIL
- [Phase 04-02]: health-check.py WARN status = write succeeded + read empty (DIAG-02 behavior); FAIL = connection refused / API down
- [Phase 04-02]: 6-stage health check reuses probe patterns from diagnose.py but is a quick status tool, not a full diagnostic; diagnose.py remains for deep analysis
- [Phase 05-01]: Removed GRAPHITI_GROUP_ID from both docker-compose.yml AND .env — both sources must be cleared since env_file directive loads .env into container
- [Phase 05-01]: Fallback triggered: group_id format project:my-cc-setup rejected by Graphiti v1.21.0 server (colon not allowed in group_id) — Plan 02 uses global scope + [project-name] content prefix
- [Phase 05-01]: MCPClient default timeout changed from 30s to 5s — hooks must fail fast to avoid blocking Claude Code sessions
- [Phase 05-02]: Hooks use global scope + [project-name] content prefix per SCOPE_FALLBACK.md — project:name colon format rejected by server v1.21.0
- [Phase 05-02]: capture-change.sh runs add-episode foreground — 10s hook-level + 5s MCPClient timeout is acceptable; error capture requires foreground
- [Phase 05-02]: Frostgale migration skipped — fallback active; project:frostgale would fail same colon constraint
- [Phase Phase 05-02]: capture-change.sh runs add-episode foreground — 10s hook-level + 5s MCPClient timeout is acceptable; error capture requires foreground execution
- [Phase Phase 05-02]: Frostgale migration skipped — fallback active; project:frostgale would fail same colon constraint as project:my-cc-setup
- [Phase Phase 05-02]: Once-per-session health warning uses PPID-keyed /tmp flag — groups all hooks from one Claude Code process, OS-cleaned on reboot
- [Phase 06-01]: sessions.json uses labeled_by field (auto|user) to control whether auto-naming can overwrite labels
- [Phase 06-01]: index-session subcommand bridges shell hooks to atomic JSON writes without jq dependency
- [Phase 06-01]: session-summary.sh always writes index entry even if Graphiti summary is empty -- ensures session discoverability
- [Phase 06-02]: Two-phase naming ensures even abnormally terminated sessions get a name from the first prompt
- [Phase 06-02]: Haiku (claude-haiku-4.5) via OpenRouter for name generation at ~$0.001 per call; max_tokens: 30
- [Phase 06-02]: Empty-label guard in index-session prevents refined naming from blanking preliminary names when summary is empty
- [Phase 06-02]: Graceful degradation: all naming calls wrapped in 2>/dev/null || true to avoid breaking hook flow

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- RESOLVED: Hooks fire and print status but actual mcp__graphiti__add_memory calls may not execute or may error silently — ACTUALLY: writes succeed, 2>/dev/null is a risk but not a current failure
- RESOLVED ROOT CAUSE: No project-scoped episodes exist — BECAUSE: server-level GRAPHITI_GROUP_ID=global overrides all group_id values to global
- Global scope has data (10+ episodes including session summaries) — scope isolation is the fix needed
