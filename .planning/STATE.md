# Project State

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Init]: Research only — no install; user wants vetted list first
- [Init]: Global scope only — everything in ~/.claude or global config
- [Init]: Lean final list capped at 5-8 tools; quality over quantity
- [Init]: Full lifecycle self-management required — user never touches config files
- [01-01]: Pre-defined INCLUDE/CONSIDER/DEFER tier criteria in Phase 1 — Phase 2 assessors assign tiers at assessment time, making Phase 3 a tabulation not a deliberation
- [01-01]: Separate "Not Evaluated" section from anti-features list — out-of-scope tools are not anti-features; distinction prevents misclassification
- [01-01]: Security findings informational only, not a hard gate — mcp-scan results documented for user decision at Phase 3

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Context7 PHP/WP coverage depth unverified at free tier (60 req/hr, 1,000/month) — verify in Phase 2 assessment
- GitHub PAT minimum scope set needs verification against GitHub OAuth docs at assessment time
- WP 7.0 timeline (April 2026) assumed; monitor developer.wordpress.org/news/ for delays
