# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-16)

**Core value:** Every recommended tool must be self-manageable by Claude Code without manual user config file edits
**Current focus:** Phase 3 - Synthesis (Phase 2 complete)

## Current Position

Phase: 3 of 3 (Synthesis — IN PROGRESS)
Plan: 1 of 1 in current phase (plan complete)
Status: Phase 3 Plan 1 complete — RANKED-REPORT.md authored, project deliverable complete
Last activity: 2026-03-16 — Plan 03-01 complete — RANKED-REPORT.md created (7 tools, full write-ups, cap math, appendix)

Progress: [██████████] 100%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 1
- Average duration: 3 min
- Total execution time: 0.05 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-methodology | 1 | 3 min | 3 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 3 min
- Trend: baseline

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Init]: Research only — no install; user wants vetted list first
- [Init]: Global scope only — everything in ~/.claude or global config
- [Init]: Lean final list capped at 5-8 tools; quality over quantity
- [Init]: Full lifecycle self-management required — user never touches config files
- [01-01]: Pre-defined INCLUDE/CONSIDER/DEFER tier criteria in Phase 1 — Phase 2 assessors assign tiers at assessment time, making Phase 3 a tabulation not a deliberation
- [01-01]: Separate "Not Evaluated" section from anti-features list — out-of-scope tools are not anti-features; distinction prevents misclassification
- [01-01]: Security findings informational only, not a hard gate — mcp-scan results documented for user decision at Phase 3
- [Phase 02-research]: GSD update is a 6-step staged process (detect version, npm check, changelog preview, user confirm, install, clear cache) — not a simple reinstall
- [Phase 02-research]: PATH absent from settings.json env block — critical prerequisite before adding any stdio MCP; recommended value /usr/local/bin:/opt/homebrew/bin:/usr/bin:/bin
- [Phase 02-research]: Coexistence doc scoped to risk flagging only, no recovery procedures — per locked 02-CONTEXT.md decision
- [Phase 02-research]: Playwright MCP INCLUDE — stateful browser automation fills gap WebFetch cannot cover; 59 tools mitigated by Tool Search lazy-loading; MEDIUM security is FEATURE for DDEV localhost testing
- [Phase 02-research]: Sequential Thinking MCP INCLUDE — 1 tool (~150-200 tokens) near-zero overhead; revision and branching features additive to, not duplicative of, model-native reasoning; monorepo stars recorded with explicit attribution
- [Phase 02-research]: Context7 MCP INCLUDE: 2 tools, ~300-500 token overhead, PHP/WP coverage depth deferred to Phase 3 hands-on testing
- [Phase 02-research]: WPCS Skill INCLUDE: file-based Skill, Stars gate adapted N/A with explanation, ~30-130 token overhead, all ops via CC native tools
- [Phase 02-research]: GitHub MCP CONSIDER: 84 tools / ~12,600 token overhead HIGH, gh CLI functional overlap documented (not duplicate), PAT scopes: repo + read:org
- [Phase 02-04]: mcp-neo4j-cypher eliminated: 918 stars below community threshold of 1,000 — re-evaluate when stars >= 1,000
- [Phase 02-04]: Session listing is a first-class gap: no list_group_ids endpoint in Graphiti MCP API; flag for v2 upstream contribution
- [Phase 02-04]: Hook Gap Tier 1: Bash error capture, semantic diffs, and task state at SessionStart are highest-value improvements closable with current hook API
- [Phase 02-research]: WRIT-01 personal/fiction creative writing — no viable dedicated tool found; haowjy/creative-writing-skills fails both stars (79) and recency (134 days) gates; flagged for v2
- [Phase 02-research]: WRIT-02 technical writing — Jeffallan/claude-skills (code-documenter) recommended INCLUDE; passes all gates, covers docs/API docs/READMEs, 6,845 stars
- [Phase 02-06]: Phase 2 cross-cutting review complete — 12/12 requirements COMPLETE, 4 INCLUDE + 1 CONSIDER named assessments, no gate violations, no INCLUDE-tier overlaps — Phase 3 READY
- [Phase 02-06]: WRIT-01 final verdict: alirezarezvani CONSIDER (professional writing only); personal/fiction — no viable candidate — flagged for v2
- [Phase 03-01]: RANKED-REPORT.md complete — 5 INCLUDE + 2 CONSIDER = 7 tools within 5-8 cap; context cost ordered ascending; Prerequisites section (PATH fix) placed first; DLVR-01/02/03, INFR-03 all satisfied

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Context7 PHP/WP coverage depth unverified at free tier — verify in Phase 3 hands-on testing
- WP 7.0 timeline (April 2026) assumed; monitor developer.wordpress.org/news/ for delays
- PATH not set in settings.json env block — critical prerequisite before adding any stdio MCP in Phase 3
