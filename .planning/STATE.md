# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-19)

**Core value:** Every capability must be self-manageable by Claude Code without manual user config file edits
**Current focus:** Phase 19 — six-subsystem-directory-restructure

## Current Position

Phase: 19 (six-subsystem-directory-restructure) — EXECUTING
Plan: 2 of 3

### Prior Milestones

v1.0 (3 phases, 8 plans), v1.1 (4 phases, 8 plans), v1.2 (4 phases, 12 plans), v1.2.1 (6 phases, 17 plans) -- all shipped.
Total prior: 17 phases, 45 plans completed.

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [v1.3-M1 roadmap]: Restructure prerequisites (resolver, circular dep test) must land before any file moves
- [v1.3-M1 roadmap]: Unified layout mapping built during restructure, not as a separate phase
- [v1.3-M1 roadmap]: MENH-06 and MENH-07 removed -- Max subscription + subagents eliminates need
- [v1.3-M1 roadmap]: SQLite last (highest risk, needs stable infrastructure and node:sqlite verification)
- [v1.3-M1 roadmap]: Phase 22 added for end-to-end verification and shim cleanup in deployed layout
- [260319-fzc]: Six-subsystem architecture, cc/ adapter pattern, milestoned delivery model
- [260319-fzc]: Switchboard dispatches but does not handle; Ledger narrows to write-only
- [260319-fzc]: Reverie reads through Assay, writes through Ledger
- [18-01]: scope.cjs is standalone (no core.cjs require) -- only 2 core<->ledger cycles exist
- [18-01]: install.cjs <-> update.cjs intra-switchboard cycle added to allowlist
- [18-01]: 8 subsystem keys in layout map including future paths (assay, terminus, reverie, cc)
- [18-02]: Dual-layout bootstrap for dynamo/ root files -- conditional require since deployed layout flattens dynamo/ to root
- [18-02]: install.cjs Step 6 changed from deleting lib/ to verifying lib/ (lib/ is now required shared substrate)
- [18-02]: SYNC_PAIRS expanded from 3 to 4 entries for lib/ deployment
- [Phase 19-01]: core.cjs bootstrap simplified to require('./resolve.cjs') since both now in lib/
- [Phase 19-01]: detectLayout() left unchanged for prep wave -- deployed marker works for existing installs
- [Phase 19-01]: layout.cjs uses pre-migration paths; updated to target paths in Plan 02
